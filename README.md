# WOW Stories website
A website full of stories that are styled like digital 'paintings'. The website is built mobile first to make it a so called 'Multi Device Design'. It's not only fully responsive, it also has a name based search without even having a database of stories!

Users are able to download a story before they are going to fly with WOW Air. Also they can like a story that they like (in the case of this prototype only the 'Gefrustreerd' story can be read). They also have the possibility to get a random generated story.

You can check the website out here: https://kriskuiper.github.io/wow-stories/src/
